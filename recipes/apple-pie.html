    <ol>
        <li>
            Preheat oven to 425 degrees and Gather all ingredients. Peel and core apples, then thinly slice and set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
            Melt butter in saucepan over medium heat. Add flour and stir, then cook for 1 - 2 minutes.
            Add both sugars and water, then bring to boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer for 3 - 5 minutes.

        </li>
        <li>
            Press one pastry into bottom and up the sides of a 9 in. pie pan.
            Roll out remaining pastry so it will overhang by 0.5 in..
            Cut pastry into eight 1-in. strips.
        </li>
        <li>
            Place sliced apples into bottom of crust. Lay four pastry strips vertically and evenly spaced over apples; use
            longer strips in center and shorter strips at edges.
        </li>
        <li>
            Make a lattice cruste. Fold the first and third strips back.
            Lay one unused strip perpendicular over second and fourth strip, then unfold first and third strip to original position.
            Fold the second and fourth vertical strips back. Lay one of the three unused strips perpendicularly over top.
